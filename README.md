# eecs168 - Introduction to VLSI Design

## Lab Resources

Every discussion/Q&A will be at https://github.com/sheldonucr/ucr-eecs168-lab. Please use GITHUB page instead of email to ask any questions to TA. Questions of confidential nature, eg. grading, are the exception. Labs must be finished on the given time. You have one week for your lab report. Lab due dates are indicated in the Lab schedule. Your lab will be due on your respective lab day (except Lab 4), eg. if your lab day is Wednesday then you will turn in your lab on the Wednesday of the week your lab is due. Please be sure to include all required deliverables in your lab report. Four lab reports are required to turn in and total score is 100.

### Attendance Policy

Lab attendance is not mandatory if you have finished the lab prior to the lab time.

## Late Submission for lab report

- Late submission will be 50% penalty.

 ### Cheating Policy

Each lab report should be individual even if you can do pair design and programming. If I find students cheating on the lab report, I give no credit for lab given report. Then I forward your case to the academic integrity board at UCR.
